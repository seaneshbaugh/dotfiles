# dotfiles

My dotfiles to set up my environment. I mostly use OSX but these should generally work anywhere.

You should probably make your own.

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:seaneshbaugh/dotfiles.git
    $ cd ~/dotfiles
    $ ./install.sh

## Notes

This is based off [Ryan Bates' old dotfile setup](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/tree/custom-bash-zsh). [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is great, but is just a bit much. I like to keep my setup as close to the default as possible and change only what I know from personal experience the things I prefer.
